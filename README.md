## Project Objectives
The main goals of this project are to:
- Analyze and clean the Spotify Top 50 Tracks dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer specific questions.
- Identify correlations and key characteristics of popular music.
- Provide visualizations to highlight findings in an easily understandable format.

## Data Description
The dataset, **Spotify Top 50 Tracks of 2020**, includes the following key features:
- **Track**: The name of the song.
- **Artist**: The name of the artist or band.

- **Danceability**: A score indicating how suitable a track is for dancing.
- **Loudness**: The overall loudness of the track in decibels.
- **Duration**: Length of the track in milliseconds.
- Additional features include tempo, energy, and more.

## Data Cleaning
I performed the following data cleaning steps:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and treated any missing values.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Eliminated duplicate samples and unnecessary columns.
- **Outlier Treatment**: Addressed outliers to ensure reliable analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
I explored the data to answer the following questions:
- How many observations and features are there in the dataset?
- Which artists have more than one track in the Top 50?
- Which genre is the most popular?
- How do features like danceability, loudness, and acousticness compare across different genres?
- What are the strongest correlations between features?

I visualized these findings using plots and graphs to provide an in-depth understanding of the data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating insightful visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For an interactive analysis environment.
